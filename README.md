# AirBnB Console Project

## Description
The ALU-AirBnB Console project is a simplified version of the AirBnB website, integrating essential components such as database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing. It represents the first step towards building a full-scale web application, enabling data management through a custom command-line interface (CLI) and establishing the base classes for storing this data.

## Command Interpreter
The Command Interpreter acts like a shell, tailored for specific use cases, allowing you to manage objects in the project. It facilitates the following capabilities:

Creating new objects
Retrieving existing objects
Updating object attributes
Deleting objects

## Steps for Developing the Command Interpreter
Set up the console for object creation, serialization/deserialization, and storage.
Build HTML/CSS files for enhancing the user interface.
Implement MySQL for managing database storage.
Deploy the application on servers using Fabric.
Integrate Flask to serve stored models and HTML.
Establish RestAPI to handle objects in JSON format.
Connect the JSON API dynamically with HTML for sharing the web application.

## Running the Console
The console can be utilized in both interactive and non-interactive modes:
- **Interactive mode**: Execute `./console.py` and enter `help` to access available commands.
- **Non-interactive mode**: Execute commands directly or via a file using `echo` or `cat`.

## Supported Commands
- **Create**: Create an object
- **Show**: Display an object based on its ID
- **Destroy**: Delete an object
- **All**: Show all objects, either of one specific type or all types
- **Update**: Modify an instance based on the class name and ID
- **Quit/EOF**: Exit the console
- **Help**: Obtain descriptions of available commands

## How to Use
Initiate the console using `./console.py`, followed by entering commands as per the supported formats.

### Update
